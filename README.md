* **Description:** Build a bot that automatically extracts details from resumes submitted in PDF format, such as name, contact information, work experience, skills, and education, and then organizes the data into a structured format (e.g., CSV or a database).
* **Extra challenge:** Integrate a recommendation system that suggests jobs based on extracted data.

### 3. **Automated Social Media Interaction**

* **Tools:** Selenium/Playwright, APIs (Twitter, Facebook, etc.)
* **Description:** Build a bot that can interact with a social media account. The bot should be able to post updates, respond to mentions, like posts, or follow accounts based on certain criteria (e.g., hashtags or keywords).
* **Extra challenge:** Implement a sentiment analysis on posts or mentions to respond only to specific kinds of posts (e.g., positive feedback or customer inquiries).

### 4. **Automated Job Application Submission**

* **Tools:** Selenium/Playwright
* **Description:** Build an automation that can automatically submit job applications on job portals. The bot should fill in a profile, upload resumes, and apply to jobs that match certain criteria (e.g., job title, location, salary).
* **Extra challenge:** Add an email notification system to confirm successful applications and handle rejections.

### 5. **Browser-Based Game Bot**

* **Tools:** PyAutoGUI, Selenium, OpenCV
* **Description:** Build a bot that can play simple browser-based games like *Flappy Bird*, *2048*, or a clicker game. The bot would need to analyze the screen, detect obstacles or points of interest, and take actions accordingly.
* **Extra challenge:** Use image recognition (OpenCV) to improve accuracy and add difficulty levels (e.g., changing reaction time).

### 6. **Dynamic Form Filling with CAPTCHA Handling**

* **Tools:** Selenium/Playwright, OCR libraries (e.g., Tesseract)
* **Description:** Automate a process of filling out forms that require solving CAPTCHA challenges. You can simulate manual user behavior (mouse movements, typing) and use OCR to solve simple text-based CAPTCHAs.
* **Extra challenge:** Integrate CAPTCHA bypass services like 2Captcha to solve more complex CAPTCHAs.

### 7. **Website Performance Monitoring Bot**

* **Tools:** Selenium/Playwright, requests, BeautifulSoup, pandas
* **Description:** Create a bot that monitors the performance of websites, checking for broken links, slow page load times, or server errors (500s, 404s). It should log these issues and notify the website admin.
* **Extra challenge:** Integrate with Slack or email for notifications and set up a dashboard that visualizes performance over time.

### 8. **Automated Data Entry with Error Handling**

* **Tools:** PyAutoGUI, Selenium/Playwright, pandas, tenacity
* **Description:** Build a bot that enters data into forms across different web pages. Implement error handling and retries in case of failures (e.g., if an element is not found or there’s an unexpected page load delay).
* **Extra challenge:** Use OCR to read non-standard input fields or images that require user input and integrate a retry logic mechanism.

### 9. **Automated Web Scraping with Proxy Rotation**

* **Tools:** Selenium/Playwright, requests, fake\_useragent, proxy libraries
* **Description:** Develop a scraper that can handle websites with anti-scraping measures (e.g., IP blocks, user-agent blocking). Rotate proxies and user agents to prevent detection.
* **Extra challenge:** Include a CAPTCHA handling mechanism and integrate a scheduler to run scraping tasks on a regular basis.

### 10. **Personalized Email Campaign Automation**

* **Tools:** Selenium/Playwright, smtplib, pandas
* **Description:** Create a bot that sends personalized emails to a list of recipients from a CSV or Excel file. The emails should include specific information tailored to each recipient (like their name, last product viewed, etc.).
* **Extra challenge:** Track email open rates and responses by embedding tracking pixels and handling opt-out requests.

### 11. **Automated Test Automation with Playwright**

* **Tools:** Playwright, pytest, allure
* **Description:** Build automated tests for a sample web application. The tests should check for various functionalities, such as form submissions, page navigation, and error handling. Use Playwright’s capabilities to handle modern web app testing.
* **Extra challenge:** Integrate a reporting system (like Allure) and set up a continuous integration pipeline (CI/CD) with GitHub Actions or Jenkins.

### 12. **PDF Report Generation**

* **Tools:** ReportLab, PyPDF2, pandas
* **Description:** Create an automation that generates dynamic PDF reports from data stored in CSV or Excel files. The reports should include tables, charts, and text content based on the data.
* **Extra challenge:** Add functionality to convert a series of HTML reports into PDFs using tools like `pdfkit` or `weasyprint`.

### 13. **Automated Webinar Registration and Data Collection**

* **Tools:** Selenium/Playwright, BeautifulSoup
* **Description:** Build a bot that automatically registers for webinars, filling in forms, and optionally, capturing post-webinar content (like video links or notes).
* **Extra challenge:** Add an OCR component to extract text from webinar slides or screenshots.

### 14. **Automated YouTube Playlist Management**

* **Tools:** Selenium/Playwright, YouTube API
* **Description:** Build a bot that can add videos to a specific YouTube playlist based on certain search queries. You can use Playwright to interact with YouTube’s interface or leverage the YouTube API.
* **Extra challenge:** Integrate an automated system that analyzes videos (e.g., using the YouTube API) to classify them into categories based on metadata or content.

### 15. **Voice Command Automation**

* **Tools:** SpeechRecognition, PyAutoGUI
* **Description:** Develop a bot that responds to voice commands to perform simple automation tasks on your computer. For example, opening applications, sending messages, or controlling media playback.
* **Extra challenge:** Integrate a natural language processing library like spaCy or NLTK to improve command interpretation.

### 16. **Automated Web-Based Data Cleaning**

* **Tools:** Selenium/Playwright, pandas, OpenPyXL
* **Description:** Automate the process of cleaning and transforming data from web-based spreadsheets or forms into a clean and structured format. This could involve data validation, filtering, and normalization.
